        <p>Hey, James Simmons here! Just a fun loving guy who enjoys gaming and loves to hear a good
            joke. Currently studying Web Design and Development through the BYU Pathway program, and
            can't wait to learn more about computers and how they work.

        <p>Arizona is a quiet little state where the heat is top-notch,
            the wildlife is serene and the sunsets are stellar. Besides the
            imminent sunburns and heatwaves it's not a bad place to settle down...
            or so decided the pioneers.</p>
